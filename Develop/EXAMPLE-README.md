  ## Description

  As a developer, I would like to focus on creating efficient and functional code. Creating README.md files take away from the time I spend coding, so I wanted to build an application that would automatically generate a markdown file using command-line inputs. I learned a lot about modules, dependencies, node and linking more than one JS file at a time.

  The application will be invoked by using the following command: node index.js
