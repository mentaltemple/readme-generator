# README Generator

[![License: WTFPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-WTFPL-brightgreen.svg)](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/)

## Description

As a developer, I wanted to focus more time and energy on writing efficient and functional code. I also wanted to understand more about building command-line applications. I built this automated README generator to help me save time in the future so I can dedicate more of my energy to coding. I learned about modules, specifically inquirer and file system, dependencies, command-line applications, licenses and more.
